// This democratizes access to publicizing ideas for Nouns governance to any address by lending proposal power 
// and lowering the barrier of entry to submitting onchain proposals. Competition is introduced by an auction
// of ERC1155s, each `tokenId` representing a single proposal. 



// proposals -> 1155s that non-nounders can mint for a fee in support of (provenance + liquidity)
// 1155 w/ most mints wins onchain, two week proposal 'ritual' to push ideas onchain based on highest mints
// split sum of minting fees between existing noun delegates in a claim() func
// non-winning tokens w/ existing votes can roll over into following two week periods
